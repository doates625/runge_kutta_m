Written by Dan Oates (WPI Class of 2020)

### Description
Runge-Kutta integration minimizes numerical integration error for functions of the form:
```
dy/dx = f(x, y)
```
Using only the function for the first derivative. This package contains the functions rk1, rk2, and rk4 for 1st-, 2nd-, and 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration, respectively.
